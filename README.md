Please be patient. When you log in ther will be a timespan of up to 20 seconds of loading. That is because I am using a free account at Heroku wich causes the Database to go to a sleep mode after a while. So the 20 seconds are needed there to start up the image again. Also I havent done a welcome screen for first users so the first thing you will see when you just registered is a message that no notes could be found. So thats normal for now. I'll be back soon to fix that and add some better UI/UX.

Also nothing here is specifically mobile-optimized. I focused on Backend and functionality first. But I will work on this project in the future for sure.
